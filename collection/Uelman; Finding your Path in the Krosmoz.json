As hard as you can!\") and is one of the rare examples of adventurers who will play the \"Stop hitting yourself!\" game all alone. In company, he'll delight everyone with his jokes about massacre and bloodshed, and his favourite party trick is juggling his enemies' organs. In short, he's a great guy to have around, and the perfect warrior companion!",

Spiteful gossips say it's actually an obsession, hence their reputation as weirdos (as admiring swollen muscles or the working of joints is pretty odd...).

Though their habits might seem confusing, they're very useful for the magic they practise!",

				"The followers of the god Sadida are gathered under the name \"Sadida's Shoe,\" which means, in Sadida language, \"Those whose shoes, soled with wind and laced with greenery, can create dew and joy within the god Sadida's heart, from the innermost depths to the edge of the forests, scented with exquisite and musky fragrances.\" This funny expression always puzzles people. The first thing you need to know about Sadidas is that they're extremely touchy when it comes to the soles of their feet. Some people say they're hard with calluses, while others say that it's the most sensitive part of their body. It might also be to do with the smell. But no one knows for sure except the Sadidas themselves. Of course, if you ask one of the leafy god's temperamental followers yourself, you'll regret it. In the end, it's your choice: live in ignorance, or run the risk of getting a thorny whack in the privates. Not hard to choose, is it?",
				"We often think Sadidas sleep all day long. The truth is, what we believe to be deep sleep is in fact a very intense activity similar to dreaming... Sadidas claim they are \"dream-passers.\" A dreaming Sadida can make a tremendous effort in the ether to harness the energies that will bring their dolls to life. They are also fond of the teachings spread by forest spirits and lesser gods. They advise the Sadida where to find the plants he needs to make their ointments and poisons. This vegetative condition enables them to converse with plants and trees. If a Sadida needs to pick up a plant or cut down a tree, they will always ask its permission, as a Sadida is in perfect harmony with Nature. Some reckon they also take special care to do it because they have the power to change into a tree and that there's something not quite right about hitting a peer with an axe.",
				"Some Sadidas set themselves up as protectors of the land. They use their Sylvan Power spell, which enables them to change into a tree, to melt into the background and remain watchful, scanning their surroundings. Ever felt like someone's watching you when you're in a supposedly deserted forest? Now you know why!",

The whole thing was almost liquid and a cloud of Crows were stumbling around it. To her great surprise, the black feathered creatures were all drunk, staggering and unable to fly. This was an epiphany, and her powers started to grow as she experimented in the art of fermentation. She tried it on everything: plants and creatures, organs and peels, they all became liquids with unique flavours, and anyone who drank them would find themselves in a trance, leaving the goddess free to wrap them around her little finger! Soon everyone around was drunk and convinced that the goddess Pandawa was fabulous! She became so famous that she took what she believed was rightfully hers: a place within the gods' pantheon!"
