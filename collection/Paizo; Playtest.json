				"Firearms require ammunition consisting of projectiles and black powder. Though a round of ammo can vary in its composition, it is typically either a prepackaged paper cartridge including wadding, bullet, and black powder or loose shot that has been packed into a cartridge manually. Some weapons, like {@item hand cannon|PT:G&G|hand cannons} and {@item blunderbuss|PT:G&G|blunderbusses}, can fire other material, but their ammunition has the same Price due to the cost of the black powder. Because making rounds of firearm ammunition requires creating black powder, you need the {@feat Alchemical Crafting} skill feat to make them.
