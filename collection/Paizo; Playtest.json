When you Manifest your Eidolon, in addition to their normal manifestation, you can call upon their powers to transform yourself into an exact duplicate of your eidolon until the eidolon becomes unmanifested. You can't use this if you Manifest your Eidolon in an unusual way, such as with the Synthesis feat. While a duplicate of your eidolon, you use your eidolon's statistics other than your mental ability modifiers, including their evolutions. You can't cast spells (unless they're spells your eidolon could cast), activate or benefit from magic items that normally benefit you and not your eidolon, or use other actions your eidolon can't normally perform. Any spells you cast with a limited number of uses count against your eidolon's uses. You can Manifest your Eidolon again to end this effect and return to your normal form."
