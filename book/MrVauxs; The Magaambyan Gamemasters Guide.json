To date, Mariama has nearly started a cult by accident while drunk, been subjected to school discipline for selling curses, and had her heirloom magical staff disintegrated by a freak bolt of lightning.",

																			"Noxolo fled from her home to escape her overbearing family, who had planned out every aspect of her life. Whispers from dead birds and cow bones told her she could find freedom at the Magaambya, and so she went, not knowing what to expect. What she discovered was a far bigger world than she’d ever dreamt possible, and a chance to unravel the mysteries of the strange whispers she hears. Though highly prone to spacing out during lectures, Noxolo does her best not to take her acceptance at the Magaambya for granted. The transition has been rougher on her than she likes to admit, however, and she often finds herself wracked with homesickness and guilt for leaving the family who cared enough about her to plan her life in such detail.",
																			"Noxolo dressed as a man to avoid being tracked down while traveling, noticing that many overlooked someone who appeared to be a man if they were searching for a woman. By the time she reached the Magaambya, Noxolo found she preferred her new look and has begun to experiment with various fashions and hairstyles.",
																			"Noxolo is accompanied at all times by a bizarre, 2-foot-long pet she refers to as her “snabble,” a creature that resembles a fuzzy cross between a crocodile and a bear cub. The creature has attracted more than its fair share of curious scholars, though Noxolo herself seems uninterested in what sort of creature it truly is or where it originally came from."

His relentless positivity in the face of challenges, setbacks, and the occasional near-death experience have likewise gained him many friends.

Though the Magaambya possess’s a much more enlightened view on anadis, Tzeniwe is still painfully aware that many humanoids are terrified of spiders. Indeed, she’s more forgiving of repulsed reactions than her friends think she should be. Possessing a cooperative and generous nature, Tzeniwe often leaves her peers small gifts to make them comfortable, such as cups of chilled tea, delicious snacks, or even soft scarves and kaftans.",

Named Zachva and Zanvi, the rambunctious pair have no qualms about jumping around in spider form, pestering other students, or climbing into places they shouldn’t. Academy students have become impressed with Tzeniwe’s ability to lasso her children from over 50 paces to retrieve them. Though Tzeniwe usually carries them with her during classes, a large spiderling on her back and a human child on one knee, she often asks others to watch them when the twins refuse to behave."
