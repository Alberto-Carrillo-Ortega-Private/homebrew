				"Your true form is not a bipedal fox like most kitsune, but instead your true form is that of a fox. While in your true fox form you are Small, you have imprecise {@ability scent} 30 feet and you have a jaws unarmed attack that deals {@damage 1d4} piercing damage. Your jaws are in the {@group brawling} group and have the {@trait finesse} and {@trait unarmed} traits. However, in your true fox shape you can't use weapons, shields, or other held items of any sort, and you are limited in what actions you can take that have the {@trait manipulate} trait. The only {@trait manipulate} actions you can take are to {@action Cast a Spell} with somatic components or simple {@action Interact} actions such as opening an unlocked door. Your paws can't perform actions that require fingers or significant manual dexterity, including any action that would require a check to accomplish. The GM might determine other {@trait manipulate} actions are appropriate for your paws. Your alternate form is a common Medium humanoid ancestry prevalent where you grew up (typically human), called a tailless form.",
				"If you take the {@feat Myriad Forms|LOAG} ancestry feat, you may choose the normal kitsune form, the bipedal fox, as the form chosen for the feat."
